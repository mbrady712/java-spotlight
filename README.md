# java-spotlight
I created this Java program in my Java Programming II course at ACC. This program puts a yellow spotlight onto an image. The user can cahnge the size of the spotlight by entering an int value into the program. The higher the int value, the smaller the visible area of the image becomes. The Framework01.java and Framework01Intfc.java files were created by my professor, Richard Baldwin. The task of the assignment was for the student to modify the Spotlight.java file so that the color of the spotlight was yellow instead of black. I did this by changing the blue and alpha values of each pixel in the image in lines 166-170 of Spotlight.java.
